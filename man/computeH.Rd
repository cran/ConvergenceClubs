\title{Compute H values}
\usage{
computeH(X, quantity = "H", id)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{matrix or dataframe containing data (preferably filtered, in order to remove business cycles)}

\item{quantity}{string indicating the quantity that should be returned. The options are
\code{"H"}, the default, only the vector of cross-sectional variance is returned; \code{"h"},
only the matrix of transition path h is return; \code{"both"}, a list containing
both h and H is returned.}

\item{id}{optional; row index of regions for which H values are to be computed;
if missing, all regions are used}
}
\value{
A numeric vector, a matrix or a list, depending on the value of \code{quantity}
}
\description{
Computes H values (cross-sectional variance) according to the clustering
algorithm by Phillips and Sul (2007, 2009)
}
\details{
The cross sectional variation \eqn{H_{it}}{H(it)} is computed as the quadratic
         distance measure for the panel from the common limit and under the
         hypothesis of the model should converge to zero as \emph{t} tends towards infinity:
             \deqn{H_t = N^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (h_{it}-1)^2 \rightarrow 0 , \quad   t\rightarrow \infty}{
                  H(t) = 1/N \sum [h(it)-1]^2 --> 0  	as   t -> infinity  }
         where
             \deqn{h_{it} = \frac{\log y_{it}}{( N^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^N log \, y_{it} )} }{
                  h(it) = N log[y(it)] / \sum log[y(it)]    }
}
\examples{
data("filteredGDP")

h <- computeH(filteredGDP[,-1], quantity="h")
H <- computeH(filteredGDP[,-1], quantity="H")
b <- computeH(filteredGDP[,-1], quantity="both")
